# Intelligent HVAC Control System & Digital Twin

### 🚀 Project Overview
This project simulates an industrial climate control unit using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** architecture. It bridges the gap between low-level embedded logic and high-level visual simulation.

### 🎥 Simulation Demo
-COMING SOON-

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Core Logic:** C Language
* **Simulation:** Unity Engine & C#

### ⚙️ Key Features
**1. Smart Decision Making:**
* `IDLE`: System in ideal range (Green).
* `HEATING`: Activates below 15°C (Blue).
* `COOLING`: Activates above 35°C (Red).
* `ALARM`: Emergency lock below 0°C or above 50°C (Black).

**2. Safety Mechanisms:**
* **Fail-Safe Mode:** Auto-shutdown on critical sensor errors.

**3. Future Enhancements & Hardware Integration**
* The next phase of this project is creating a **Physical HVAC Controller Prototype** by using Arduino or similar microcontroller. This prototype will include temperature or humidity sensors and actuators that will control real-time actions. All Arduino codes, wiring diagrams and component lists will be added upon completion.
